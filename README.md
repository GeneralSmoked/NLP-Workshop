ðŸŽ­ Romeo and Juliet Text Analysis with TextBlob & WordCloud

This project explores text mining and sentiment analysis using Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. The goal was to apply TextBlob for basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment scoring and noun phrase extraction, and to generate a WordCloud to visually highlight frequent words in the play.

ðŸ“š Project Overview

As part of my NLP learning journey, I wanted to experiment with classic literature and see what basic text analysis could reveal. I chose Romeo and Juliet due to its rich language, emotional weight, and cultural relevance. Using Python's TextBlob and WordCloud libraries, I processed the full text to identify common words, explore sentiment, and visualize the result in a compelling word cloud.

ðŸ§  Personal Learnings

Learned how to clean and preprocess raw text, especially from literary sources with old-style formatting and punctuation.

Explored how TextBlob can extract noun phrases, calculate polarity (positivity/negativity), and identify subjectivity.

Understood that sentiment analysis on literary English can be tricky â€” Shakespearean tone and irony are often lost in basic models.

Gained experience generating a WordCloud to visually reflect the most frequent and dominant words in the play.

Appreciated how even simple NLP tools can give new insight into classic literature.
